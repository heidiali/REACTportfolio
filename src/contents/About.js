                <h3>Full Stack Web Developer | Bioscientist </h3>
                <br></br>
                <p> Experience from biosciences among research, customer service and project management in multicultural work environments. Programming experience as junior full stack web developer. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p> I started my career as a bioscientist, but doing image and data analysis I quickly came to appreciate just how much software and coding skills can aid us. So thus started my journey into the world of computers. Web development is my center of interest, I like the idea of cross-platform development,
                    which web technology like Javascript and .NET Core enables me to do. I also like making solutions that make the everyday life easier. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p> I enjoy new challenges and continuous learning. My core strengths are great organizational and communication skills as well as ability to learn new things fast. </p>
