            <br></br>
            <p>I started my career as a bioscientist, but doing image and data analysis
                 quickly came to appreciate just how much software and coding skills can aid us. 
                So started my journey into the world of computers. I'm now working as a full stack developer.
                <br/>
                Web development is my center of interest, I like the idea of cross-platform development, 
                which web technology like Javascript and .NET Core enables me to do. I also like making solutions that make everyday life easier.
